<br/>
Natours is a tour booking web app that I created as part of the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Node.js course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann</a>. The app uses Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a RESTful API and a dynamic website. The app also implements authentication, authorization, security, payments and email features.

## ***Overview***
This web application allows it's users to book tour vacations.

A tour refers to a series of locations, specially picked to excite the adventurous spirit of the individual who books it.

A visiting user who has not yet created an account on the app can simply see all the current tours as well as detailed information about each tour.

Once signed up or logged in, they can then book any tour of their choice.

Users can write only one review for any tour they book.
